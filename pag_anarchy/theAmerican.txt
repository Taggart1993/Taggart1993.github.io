After getting home, working late on his eleven-hour shift in the industrial farms stretching for hundreds of miles around the town, the Unnamed Man opened the door of his Residential Room. He was as exhausted as a car out of petrol, much too tired to make it to his bed. He sat down on his rocking chair next to the lamp in the general sector of the Residential Room.

He knew this chair. It was that old chair, made of wood from the tree from the seed from the apple his long-lost mother had given him, so many years ago. He loved this chair; this chair still smelled like her. It was the only thing he had left of his dear parents. Slowly reaching out to turn off the lamp next to it, he reveled in the smell of the many melons squeezed dry by his hands in the past day. He took in the sights of the room he had lived in since he graduated from childhood all that time ago. Just as he was about to fall into sleep for the few hours he had left until the next day, he heard it. 

A voice, scratching and creaking like a tree under wind; coming from the floor in front of him. "Hello there." Hands shaking like an earthquake, he reached towards the light. The man shouted, "Who's there?" as he slowly pulled the chain to turn on the lamp. No response; the light failed to turn on. "Who are you?", the man yelled, as the light started to turn on. There was nothing in the room but him.

Slowly, a bulge in the rug rose up like dough being baked; there was something under the rug! As the Unnamed Man raised the chair above his head, ready to strike, the voice finally spoke again.

"You can call me The Nationalist. The world you know is not real."
