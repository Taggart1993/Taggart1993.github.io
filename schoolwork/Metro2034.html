		<p><i>Metro 2034</i> is a novel by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky (sequel to his previous work <i>Metro 2033</i>); set in a post-nuclear universe, <br>where the scattered remnants of humanity live pitiful, short lives underground.</p>
		<p><i>Metro 2034</i> follows three protagonists: Hunter, a grizzly ex-soldier with esoteric intentions; Sasha, a young girl who is unsure of what to do in life; and Homer, an old man who simply <br>wants to finish his great masterpiece poem before he dies.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately for our trio, a plague is breaking out near <i>Rimskaya</i>, and fate seems to have decided they should be the ones to stop it.</p>
		<p>You can read more about the novel <a href="https://metrovideogame.fandom.com/wiki/Metro_2034" target="blank">here.</a></p>
