WHY TIKTOK IS BAD

“I'm curious why people are using TikTok to make video gifs these days. I was banned from the reddit sub r/TikTok for posting a single comment about how TikTok censors Tiananmen and Tibet references. Sure would be a shame if others knew about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/d948n2/tiktok_censors_references_to_tiananmen_and_tibet?sort=confidence But who cares about that right? It's not like...

TikTok had vulnerabilities as recent as last month, which allowed attackers to gain control of users accounts to upload videos or view private videos, while a separate flaw allowed attackers to retrieve personal information from TikTok user accounts through the company’s website. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/technology/tiktok-security-flaws.html

Its almost as if Tiktok is China’s attempt at pushing their propaganda out to the world while also having massive privacy issues. China has realized that to control the global population you have to control social media and what people see. So for the last year they have been pouring a ton of money into getting their social media app to be accepted and widely used- through a campaign of paid content creation/submission, vote manipulation. Once they have widescale buy in, their backdoor monitoring and data collection will have free reign. I find it a worrying trend how easily Reddit is blindly up-voting these gifs and supporting a company with such privacy concerns, an obvious agenda, and that is censoring and controlling the information you see. It's not too late to do something.”

For those who say Reddit is Chinese owned, it’s not. Although China does own a share of Reddit, it is minimal and as a result, they don't have any control over reddit, let alone what gets to the front page or not. China does own Tik Tok though. https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tencent-reddit-20190211-story.html And https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/
